# 16-bit-Ripple-Carry-Adder-Cum-Subtractor
Reconfigurable 16-bit Ripple Carry Adder Cum Subtractor in Verilog: Design and Implementation.    

This project implements a 16-bit reconfigurable ripple carry adder cum subtractor using Verilog hardware description language (HDL). The design and simulation were carried out in Xilinx Vivado 2021.2.
## Overview
The 16-bit Ripple Carry Adder Cum Subtractor project aims to design and implement a reconfigurable arithmetic circuit using Verilog hardware description language (HDL). The project leverages the concept of a ripple carry adder to create a circuit that can perform both addition and subtraction operations on 16-bit binary numbers.
Simulation and testing were performed using Xilinx Vivado 2021.2.
